Problems

1) Need for centralized architecture - Either SMP or Voting algorithm to store the data.
2) Frontier Searching without boundaries (Needs ACO)
3) Iterative deployment 

Understanding-

Step1) Computing Voronoi Regions
Step2)  Identifying Frontier Cells- Iterate over the search space.
For each discovered cell, check its 4-connected neighbors.
If a neighbor is undiscovered and belongs to the same Voronoi region (same drone in voronoiMap), it's added to the drone's list of frontier cells.
Step3) Moving Drones Towards Frontier Cells
Step 4) Recalculate voronoiMap
